Boost your WordPress blog with PHP injections.

== Description ==

[Nzymes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nzymes/) is the 3rd major release of my [Enzymes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enzymes/) plugin. See the [Appendix](http://andowebsit.es/blog/noteslog.com/nzymes/appendix/) of the [Manual](http://andowebsit.es/blog/noteslog.com/nzymes/) to learn why I had to change its name.

Nzymes allows blog authors to inject static and dynamic content at exact locations.
