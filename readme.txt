Boost your WordPress blog with PHP injections.

== Description ==

Nzymes is a WordPress plugin for injecting enzymes into a blog. An injection is always an expression like this: {[ enzyme-1 | enzyme-2 | … enzyme-N ]}

What is an enzyme?

1. Anything that is stored into an attribute of a post or a user.
1. Anything that is stored into a custom field of a post or a user.
1. Anything that is returned by evaluating a custom field value in PHP.
1. Strings and unsigned integers.

The “Hello, World!” injection for Nzymes is: {[ =Hello, World!= ]}.

Nzymes automatically filters title, excerpt and content of any post type, looking for injections. It orderly computes the result of each enzyme of an injection and replaces the result of the last enzyme to the whole injection.
