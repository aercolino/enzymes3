Boost your blog with PHP injections.

== Description ==

[Nzymes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nzymes/) is the 3rd major release of my [Enzymes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enzymes/) plugin. See the [Appendix](http://andowebsit.es/blog/noteslog.com/nzymes/appendix/) of the [Manual](http://andowebsit.es/blog/noteslog.com/nzymes/) to learn why I had to change its name.

Nzymes allows authors to inject static and dynamic content at exact locations of a WordPress blog.

There is nothing an enzyme cannot do: Sky is the limit.
